// Shared app version constant — update here and in android/app/build.gradle
// v2.10.55: Member Produce Statement print layout fixes —
//           (1) DATE column widened from 10 → 12 (clear gutter before REC NO).
//           (2) Produce title (e.g. "MBUNI RECORD") trimmed + preview wrapped
//               in justify-center flex so it visually matches print output.
//           (3) Two leading newlines before company name so it doesn't print on
//               the tear edge.
//           (4) New optional CENTER line on receipt — resolves to active dashboard
//               route → most recent transaction's route → farmer's registered route.
//               Backend /api/periodic-report/farmer-detail now returns
//               transaction_route(_name) and farmer_route_name (additive).
// v2.10.54: Bluetooth — prevent printer/scale cross-disconnects on Android.
//           (1) Device-scoped disconnect callbacks: BleClient.connect callbacks
//           now ignore disconnect events for ids that don't match the active
//           scale/printer slot — fixes "scale connects → printer reports
//           disconnected" caused by Android GATT renegotiation.
//           (2) quickReconnect/quickReconnectPrinter: only call BleClient.disconnect
//           when the deviceId matches the current slot — avoids killing the
//           other device via process-wide GATT reset.
//           (3) scanForPrinters: pause scale notifications during LE scan and
//           reduce default scan window from 5s → 3s to minimize GATT contention.
//           (4) PrinterSelector startup auto-reconnect: defer up to 5s when the
//           scale was just connected (lastScaleConnectedAt within 5s).
//           (5) Settings + PrinterSelector: verify with verifyXxxConnection
//           before flipping UI badge to "disconnected" on spurious events.
// v2.10.53: (1) Add Member: backend now hard-fails on duplicate (mcode, ccode)
//           with a clear 409 toast — removed silent auto-increment retry.
//           (2) Periodic Report: cross-device visibility within same ccode.
//           Backend dropped t.deviceserial filter (kept ccode multi-tenant
//           boundary) and added optional `route` query param. Frontend reads
//           active route from localStorage.active_session_data and passes it
//           to /periodic-report and /periodic-report/farmer-detail; route is
//           shown as a badge and included in the local cacheKey.
//           Z-Reports remain device-isolated (unchanged).
// v2.10.52: Fix Debtors picker hiding new D-prefix members (dropped the
//           crbal != 0 requirement in Store/AI). Enforce active-mode prefix
//           in farmer resolver (typing D03558 while Members is active now
//           toasts "Switch to Debtors" instead of selecting). Listen for
//           `membersUpdated` in Store/AI to refresh farmers immediately
//           after Add Member, with a remote getByDevice refresh when online.
// v2.10.51: Coffee session contract — frontend ALWAYS sends SCODE as the backend
//           session value for coffee orgs (Buy/Store/AI, online + offline replay).
//           Adds backend_session to sessionMetadata resolver, clears sessions
//           IndexedDB store on save (no stale legacy entries), forces refresh
//           when cached coffee sessions lack SCODE. Dairy AM/PM unchanged.
// v2.10.50: Fix coffee transactions.session still storing AM/PM. Backend now
//           never collapses coffee sessions to AM/PM (uses SCODE → descript →
//           active-season DB lookup) across /api/milk-collection, /api/sales,
//           /api/sales/batch. Frontend forwards session_descript and clears
//           legacy coffee session cache without SCODE on Dashboard mount.
// v2.10.49: Fix Camera.then() unhandled rejection on Android — wrap plugin proxy
//           in object before returning from async fn (Promise-resolution probes
//           `.then` on Capacitor Proxy and throws on Android).
// v2.10.48: Fix Android camera crash (remove static @capacitor/camera enum imports);
//           add DialogDescription for a11y; backend diagnostic log for coffee SCODE.
